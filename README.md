#Title: Movie Theater Guide
#Description:
    -This project was created as a learning tool for learning how to convert web components to React components. After completing the assignment as directed, I refactored the project. It features artificial showtimes and information for three films. Clicking on the film images will open a trailer in a new tab.
    -The change I made was to include a link to a YouTube video of each movie's respective original trailer. The project already included an icon that looked like a play button triangle, and a placeholder "#" for the link. I added the link to the YouTube video in the json file, and then referenced the json file to get the corresponding link.
#How to Run: Download all files. Run a local server of your choice. Open index.html. Clicking on the images will open the original theatrical trailer in a new tab.
